Mr. Safu:
The EcoChain project revolves around the $EcoChain token and improving the environment.
Many people would be perplexed as to how a blockchain-based cryptocurrency can help the environment, but one project has done so in the simplest yet most effective way conceivable.
A percentage of the tokens' proceeds will go toward planting new trees.
Users of the $EcoChain Token will be able to select where the tree from their money will be planted. As a result, people will feel as if they are contributing to the planet's survival.
By planting trees and forestation, this effort will help to solve some of the world's most serious concerns.

"In an age where everyone is attempting to be more environmentally conscientious, you might ask if cryptocurrencies can be made even more environmentally friendly than they now are. What more can we ask for? They produce far less waste and have a lower carbon footprint than other Cryptocurrencies."
